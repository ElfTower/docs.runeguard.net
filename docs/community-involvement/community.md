# Community Involvement

Community involvement is a major core philosophy of the team when developing Runeguard. We aim to be transparent about our development process and hope to stay true to our vision of what Runeguard is and will become in the years to come. We will not be one of those AAA studios who finally leaks a teaser after 5 years of development. We invite our community to not only share in our vision, but help shape it as well. We have all our cards on the table so to speak.

## Bounties

Bounties are a way for us to reward the community for contributing to the games development. These bounties will be announced in our discord. The goal here is to provide an accessible way for community members to showcase their talents while clearly expressing the current needs of the development team. 

Bounties will be put out as timed events or open contracts that we are always looking to see more of. Bounties submissions that we feel are a good fit for the game or even ones we simply like will be rewarded. These rewards will be clearly stated as the bounty rolls out. 

A variety of bounty types will be available, examples being: card art, game music, sound effects, song lyrics, short stories, poems, character design, creature creation, etc. 

We really want to use this bounty system as a way to see our early adopters make their mark on the game.

## Testing phases

When we feel the game has had noteworthy updates we will notify the community that new features are available for testing. Sometimes these will be small events with live Q&As. Other times these will be full blown events with rewards for feedback and participation.
