# Card Minting

When It comes to our cards we want to keep them as unique and valuable to the core gameplay as possible. The core spirit of Runeguard is being a strong trading card game that can stand next to the giants we see on the market today. Given that we are a next generation game we have the opportunity to use these new technologies to bring a real physical trading card game printing model to our digital game. 

Why would we want to use a traditional card printing model in a digital game you ask?

Harken back to the days of old when you open a pack of Pokemon cards and you notice something different about the cards but can't tell what. So you open your pokedex themed card protector and you begin to skim through your collection. You notice that your new cards now have a different border around them that your older cards do not. Now you have cards that new players to the game will never be able to get unless you trade with them.

This may seem like an extraneous detail but to an avid card collector this is something to be desired. Cards go out of print, little design flaws go unnoticed, variations between print cycles are seen, new card art for reprinted cards are made, and the list goes on. 

Creating variety, scarcity, increased rarity, and demand for the cards in Runeguard is of paramount importance. Once a set of cards go out of print those cards will never be reprinted. Certain creatures or characters in that set will be reused for gameplay purposes, but they will have different card art and will be themed appropriately for the new set. An Ironmitt Brawler of old will never be the same as an Ironmitt Brawler printed today.
