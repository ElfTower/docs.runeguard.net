# Staking

## Competitive Staking Pools
We will be the first to feature competitive staking pools where only those who have collected enough tokens and NFTs can stake. Since our token will only mint at a controlled rate every year, we can launch a minting pool that features multiple levels. Each level would only allow a certain number of users a "seat" so they can earn staking rewards. Users would lock their earned tokens and NFTs into the minting pool contract in hopes to earn a seat. The contract would pick the users that have the largest number of tokens locked in along with the rarest NFTs and award them a seat in a staking pool where they will earn rewards.
