# NFTs
There are three ways NFTs would be utilized in-game, through digital land ownership, trading cards, and in-game items. These NFTs would ensure the player who purchased these truly owns them.

## Digital Land Deeds
Hirelm offers a gameplay focused NFT land ownership system. Players will grow crops, host tournaments, merrymake, and even manage marketplaces on their very own land. Whether you live in the frigid mountains among the wizards, or the sprawling city states of man and dwarf there is always value to be had in building upon your land.

Our initial plots of land will be farming based and will not have varying tiers. However in the alpha release and beyond, there will be varying tiers of land that have different properties.

For example, in future versions, certain lands purchased will allow for the growing of certain types of crops, or allow only certain types of structures to be built.

## Trading Cards
Using newly forged, in-depth, TCG gameplay, players build a collection that is truly their own. Unlike most digital “TCGs” Runeguard has no trade restrictions on player collections. Cards, booster packs, character cosmetics, player structures and all other digital collectables are NFTs of which their owners can manage free from limitations.

## In-Game Items
Found items within the world of Hirelm can offer increased utility and value to player’s land in the form of an NFT. These NFTs would be locked to players no matter where they travel, or locked to their plots of land depending on the type of item.
