# Tournaments

A strong competitive trading card game environment is something that us being long time TCG enthusiasts want for Runeguard. The feeling of walking into a massive convention center packed with thousands of people with their decks at the ready is an amazing experience. We really want to capture this experience in game and we are giving players the tools to do so no matter their skill level. 

## Weekly Events

Throughout the week players can come together at Port Townâ€™s favorite pub ,The Bard and Brigand, to participate in a variety of different formats: competitive and casual. Entry costs and rewards will vary based on the event. Such rewards will include; card packs, our native in-game tokens, exclusive cards, in-game items, and much more. Our current list of formats include: 
Standard: The base ruleset of Runeguard. Games are played in a best of 3 format.
Drafts: Players take turns selecting cards from booster packs to create a deck from cards outside their current collection. 
Specialty Formats: TBA

## Prestige Tournaments

For players who love high level competitive play and all the glory that comes with it we will be offering Prestige Tournaments. These tournaments will take place over the course of a weekend and require a higher entry fee than your scheduled weekly events. Players who do well in the tournament will find themselves with very exciting rewards; one example being an exclusive single print card for the tournament champion. Many more exciting rewards and things to come for our players who enjoy this play style. 

Currently we have not established a schedule for this tournament format. We want to make sure we have enough players to populate such an event and have unique rewards that live up to the accomplishments of players.    

## Player Hosted Bouts

At any time players will be able to host small special events on their player owned land. The rulesets and rewards for these bouts are determined by the host. We are still working out the details of this feature, but we are very excited to give players the agency to come together and organize their own events. More details on bouts are on the way. 

## Alpha Playtests 

As runeguard is still in the early stages of development we want to facilitate a fun and rewarding environment for our early adopters to try out the game and give their highly valued feedback. Small tournaments exclusive to our discord community will be held throughout game development. In these events players will have their pick of 5 premade decks which they will then use to compete. Everyone who participates will receive rewards exclusive to the event as a thanks to all our founders. Our goal with these alpha playtests are to test our game features while giving our community a look into what's to come with Runeguard. Join our discord to see when the next community playtest is happening!
