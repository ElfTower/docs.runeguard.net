# Story
In the heart of the mountains of Hirelm resides a sentient being: The Mountain Core. the very essence of magic itself. This crystalized well of perpetual creation transfigures its environment and those who reside within it. The will of the mountain core seeps up from deep within and out into Hirelm beguiling those who seek to gain knowledge of its power. 
Many come to Hirelm chasing rumors of the power living within. From distant lands they travel, settling, and engaging with the locals above and below the rock. The player is one of those distant travelers. 
There is no overarching linear narrative the player is forced to follow. The lore will be delivered through environmental storytelling, NPC quests and dialogue, trading card art and flavor text, and in-game item text.

We start our adventure in Hirelm: A nomad mountain landscape full of peculiar characters, places, and mystiques. The land showcases frozen mountain vistas, lush forests, lakes, mountain springs, waterfalls, and fertile wildlife. It is populated by many races and structures varying from dorf fortresses, human settlements, and wizard towers. Into the mountains of Hirelm lie many subterranean biomes that dig deep into the mountain.Noble Dwarves: Live in crystal carved spire palaces that originate in the Mantle, near the heart of the mountain. The light given off by the Core, is absorbed and channeled through the spire all the way to the Firmament and sometimes extends upward towards the surface and peaks. Living amongst the light is a privilege reserved for the most Noble birth.

	Middle Dwarves: a variety of dwarf that transverse both upper and lower worlds. 


	Red Dwarves:As the last of the Guardians, Dworro are subject to the intense energy of the mountain core, and without crystal armor they are warped into immense, bulking, but crooked figures and scarred 	red flesh and hair gone white..
