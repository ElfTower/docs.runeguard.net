## Player Retention
Ideally the players will be able to acquire a plethora of cards from the base set of the game for free. This will allow for a community of players to grow. The players will have enough variety in cards to create decks and play against one another and AI systems. Even though a card is free it doesnt need to be obsolete. This will create a community that’s worth differentiating yourself from by buying premium content.

The only decks available for free initially will be three starter decks representing a particular faction and showcasing various elements of our game. When a player creates their account and enters the game they are offered the choice between these three playable decks. Their choice of deck will be used as they play through the tutorial. After the tutorial is completed the deck and cards in it will be put into their card collections. The other two decks may be acquired through single player modes such as defeating an AI. After this players will be able to acquire free rewards through single player gameplay or through playing against other players.

Basic Packs will be given to new players after acquiring each of the initial starter decks. This will showcase the pack structure and introduce them to new cards while getting those endorphins flowing. Free packs can also be rewards for a pre-launch signup bonus.

## Community
Runeguard’s gameplay experience is much more rewarding when engaging with the community. Whether you are voting on the next buff in your residential coterie or taking on complicated TCG challenges it's always best to have a strong in-game community. We are also applying this philosophy to our community outside of the game world.

By hosting community driven social events, and incentivizing community members to get involved with the developing process we aim to foster a devoted fan base for years to come. Artist Bounties are a way for aspiring game artists to get involved with creating art for their favorite up and coming cards. Community run tournaments enable competitive scenes to form and evolve with rulesets highly accepted by its participating members. These are just a few examples of systems that facilitate emergent community behaviors.
