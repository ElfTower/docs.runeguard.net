# Development
We plan to leverage existing technologies and assets to make Runeguard come to life. Thankfully, with the latest tools that are available we can develop this game faster, securer, and easier than ever before.

With all our backend deployments we would be building tagged docker images, to ensure maximum security, performance, and quality control.

## Frontend/Backend Website
We would be using HotStaq/Hotpreprocessor to develop and maintain the site. This would allow us to easily create the frontend and the backend quickly and securely, along with the test cases to go with them.

With the test cases we can utilize monitoring services to ensure that our site is not only online, but operating the way it’s intended to be.

## Game Client
We’ve selected Unity for our game development as it’s incredibly popular and powerful. It allows for easy web browser, iOS, and Android app building utilizing the same codebase and assets.

## Backend Game Server
For the backend we would be utilizing some of Unity’s built non-graphical Linux binaries along with our server-side frameworks that would help us prevent cheating.

## Card Artwork
We would be reaching out to our community to help us create these card artworks.
