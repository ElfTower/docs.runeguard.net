## Competitor Analysis
**Hearthstone:** Hearthstone is without question the most popular CCG on the market. Itâ€™s well known fantasy setting, and the Blizzard Entertainment developer tag makes this title a genre staple. Hearthstone frequently ranks top 10 in twitch viewership, has a massive esports scene, and currently sees a player base of about 3.5 million across all platforms [Techacake](https://techacake.com/how-many-people-play-hearthstone/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20more%20than%203.5,million%20registered%20Hearthstone%20players%20worldwide.).

**Gwent:** 2,900 players per month [SteamCharts](https://steamcharts.com/app/1284410#1y). We believe Gwent was not able to effectively capture an audience due to a difficult learning curve, several abrupt gameplay changes, and appealed too much to a very niche audience.

**Magic:** The Gathering Arena: Another incredibly popular game that has nearly 3 million active users [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_Arena).

## Target Audience
Our target audience is the 18 - 35 audience. According to VentureBeat, an estimated 37 million gamers play CCG (aka TCG) trading card games worldwide, with 80% of them being males around the age of 31.

## Platforms
Due to varying app store constraints, we are targeting WebGL enabled web browsers first. Our game will run in nearly any web browser as far back as 2017, and on nearly any desktop or mobile device from 2018 on. This will allow us to reach the largest audience possible.

We want our experience to be as frictionless as possible by allowing players to jump directly into the game immediately without having to deal with numerous options screens and login screens. A web browser game would give us the ability to do this and allow our users to easily share links to Runeguard.
